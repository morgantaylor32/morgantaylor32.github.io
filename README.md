I've been working as a Data Scientist at Sorenson Communications until recently.  I greatly enjoyed my job, and loved how I was able to transfer computational and programming skills from astrophysics to help the company at Sorenson Communications.  This role provided me the opportunity to use machine learning techniques to build and productionalize forecasting models.  I also participated in various data analysis projects for different services.  Examples include cost tracking, Video Relay Service Research and statistics (included customer activity and churn analysis), and a provide robust data analysis for a legal case. 

Since graduating, I was able to be an online adjunct instructor for Maricopa Community College for the College Physics II course.  This has helped me refresh my physics knowledge and have the opportunity to mentor and teach students.  My favorite part of this temporary job was writing the exams.  It's been a way to express my creativity.


I received my Ph.D in Astrophysics at Arizona State University in 2023.
My advisor was Dr. F.X. Timmes, and his expertise is in stellar evolution theory.  Within that realm, my research focused on White Dwarf (WD) seismology. 
By analyzing seismic signatures from WDs, it is possible to constrain their interior structure which encapsulates their evolution history.  The seismic signals have far reaching implications for constraining important nuclear reaction rates that are necessary for the creation of elements that are needed for life.

Due to the nature of my work, I have experience using stellar evolution codes, stellar oscillation codes, various coding languages, machine learning for forecasting, data visualization, Azure Databricks, Snowflake, PowerBI, and a working knowledge in AWS. I have learned the importance of data validation and reliability, data cleaning, and data quality.
