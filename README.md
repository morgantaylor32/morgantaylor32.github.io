I've been working as a Data Scientist at Sorenson Communications until recently.  I greatly enjoyed my job, and loved how I was able to transfer computational and programming skills from astrophysics to help the company at Sorenson Communications.  This role provided me the opportunity to use machine learning techniques to build and productionalize mulitple time-series forecasting models.  I also participated in a legal case, where I provided a robust investigation of our data to mitigate the claimed legal expenses from the opposing counsel. As the true unaccounted for costs in overtime were far less than what was claimed, this effort saved the company a substantial amount of money.  I was also part of  various data science projects such as pipeline development, cost tracking, product and customer analysis and statistics (included customer activity and churn analysis), code reviews, data transfer, data visualization, and data quality.  Most of my work done at Sorenson was in the Databricks, Snowflake, and AWS platforms. 
  

Since graduating, I was able to be an online adjunct instructor for Maricopa Community College for the College Physics II course, and an adunct lab instructor for the same course at Grand Canyon University.  This helped me hone in my physics knowledge and have the opportunity to mentor and teach students.  Interestingly, I greatly enjoyed writing the exams; it was fun to see how creative I could get coming up with physics problems.  The best part of the job was being able to help students.  While teaching online doesn't provide as many opportunities to interact directly with students, I loved when students attended virtual office hours and we could work one-on-one through areas they were having difficulty.  These sessions were fruitful for me and the students; it was always fullfilling when students left excited that they understood and overcame solving complex problems. 


I received my Ph.D in Astrophysics at Arizona State University in 2023.
My advisor was Dr. F.X. Timmes, and his expertise is in stellar evolution theory.  Within that realm, my research focused on White Dwarf (WD) seismology. 
By analyzing seismic signatures from WDs, it is possible to constrain their interior structure which encapsulates their evolution history.  The seismic signals have far reaching implications for constraining important nuclear reaction rates that are necessary for the creation of elements that are needed for life.



Due to the nature of my work, I have experience using stellar evolution codes, stellar oscillation codes, various coding languages, machine learning for forecasting, data visualization, Azure Databricks, Snowflake, PowerBI, and general knowledge in AWS. I have learned the importance of data validation and reliability, data cleaning, and data quality.
