Morgan is working on her Ph.D in Astrophysics at Arizona State University.
She is working with Dr. F.X. Timmes in the field of stellar evolution theory, with a primary focus on White Dwarf (WD) seismology. 
Through analyzing seismic signatures from WDs, it is possible to constrain their interior structure which encapsulates their evolution history.
Morgan is also gaining experience with machine learning to match observed variable white dwarfs with her data.
