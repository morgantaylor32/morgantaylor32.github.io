I am working on my Ph.D in Astrophysics at Arizona State University.
My advisor is Dr. F.X. Timmes, and his expertise is in stellar evolution theory.  Within that realm, my research focuses on White Dwarf (WD) seismology. 
By analyzing seismic signatures from WDs, it is possible to constrain their interior structure which encapsulates their evolution history.  The seismic signals have far reaching implications for constraining important nuclear reaction rates that are necessary for the creation of elements that are needed for life.

Due to the nature of my work, I have experience using stellar evolution codes, stellar oscillation codes, various coding languages, and a working knowledge in machine learning.
